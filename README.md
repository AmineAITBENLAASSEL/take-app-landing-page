# [Take: mobile app landing page template](https://jasonbaciulis.github.io/take-app-landing-page/) 

Take is a fictitious mobile app for taking photos and adding effects. It was built on Bootstrap 4 and is fully responsive accross all devices.

For scrolling effects I used [GreenSock](https://greensock.com/) animation platform and [ScrollMagic](http://scrollmagic.io/).

Also, this project utilizes [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) for performance optimization and faster workflow.

Here you can find the [PSD design template](http://blazrobar.com/free-psd-website-templates/take-a-free-mobile-app-landing-page-psd-template/) created by [Blaz Robar](http://blazrobar.com/).
